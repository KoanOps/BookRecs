# Programming
## Books
- Knuth – *The Art of Computer Programming*
- Kernighan – *The C Programming Language*, 2nd ed
## Practice Paths
- Convert a project from another language you already know into C *(easiest path)*
- Read a lot of C code, modify it, observe the effect *(easier path if you have good memory)*
- Take a Microprocessor Applications course to understand Assembly and its connection to C *(harder path)*
- Write a lot of C code from scratch *(hardest path)*
