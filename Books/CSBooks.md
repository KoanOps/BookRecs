# Programming
- Kernighan – *The C Programming Language*, 2nd ed

## Practice
- Convert your large project in say Python you already know into C *(easiest path, UNIX preferred, C lib is small)*
- Read a lot of C code, modify, observe effect, repeat *(easier path if you have good memory)*
- Take a Microprocessor Applications course to understand Assembly, and its connection to C *(harder path)*
- Write a lot of C code from scratch *(hardest path)*
