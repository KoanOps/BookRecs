# What Models Work vs. Don't Work

- Fundamental Analysis works (tips odds in your favor)  
- Technical Analysis doesn't work (test and see for yourself)
- Simple Linear Regression can work (main "model" in DE Shaw)  
- Supervised Neural Nets work  
- LSTM doesn't work  
- CNN-LSTM hybrids (for sentiment analysis): maybe  
- Transformers for small instances of signal: sometimes work  
- Trend following doesn't work (unless you are HFT market makers)
