# A Vol Box - Ross

A vol box is, layman terms...

Most materially sized firms have regulatory filings...

That means they are constraint by, fixed or rolling windows of mitigating their exposures.  
250 days, 500 days. Rolling or expanding...

This means every quarter, every mid year every whole year they have to publish how they mitigate this exposure...

But two banks in same country dabble in same markets..  
Filing tells me firm A is a clown (which I can backtrack in movements because they are so big) the other isn't.  
Regulatory arbitrage times 4 a year. A long short pair.

Now it also means that if there are fixed windows and rolling windows where a regulator looks at, it means nothing but if a fixed window is 250-day rolling, you can easily build a model that checks every last 250-day returns, and volume, and intraday spike, and given it's rolling you see every new day how that compares with previous distribution.  
If the returns are constantly sitting in the tail of a rolling window of a ticker, you know they need full on mitigating mode.  
So you grab a filing and see them not doing that.

Because these filings are month end.  
Hence why the Disneys, Exxon, Lloyds—they buy hedges on close of business month end or day before, and close the day after (first) to mask the filing of that number.  
If the st.dev or the variance of that number between two competitors of same magnitude differs, one is run by toddlers, with no ALM function (as they are meant to forecast and mitigate that) while the other one keeps stable.  

Various opportunities occur.

Mean reversion models (during market liquidity shortage) + a long/short box of these two + if you know as of late the overall volume, return, intraday spikes versus historically have been higher than normal, a vol box occurs during 4 quarters a year, because the f1 ml hf donkeys will at announcement cause for a dump or pump but those f1 ml hf donkeys are only good in a few things.  

Hold hands. Be fragile flowers. Code like nerds.  
But any fundamental intrinsic knowledge isn't there.  

So you know they build a model around earnings, around macro announcements, because it seems "obvious" to doo, we are hedgies, we see moments in the future and they have a finite way of capturing that.  
They can forecast the move at earnings but they are always wrong.  
Because they don't know how to read a SEC filing.  

So they have a 10k code script to forecast how onions make tears when you cut them and somehow spurious relates to a movement of a fixed publication in the future.  
This we go left or we go right, causes volatility in spikes.  

Plus you already know you have historically high volatility so the big material players during these times have to hedge off.  

Given their size (look at total size of balance sheet, or differential between total deposits and total net interest income of two firms which have roughly same amount of holders), and you by this alone already tell which has more delinquencies going on.  
Because of this, you also know the forecasting of mismatched cash flow tenor bucket wise in the future is gonna break.  
That means that you have inside information at some point they will:

- Raise capital  
- Issue bonds, go capital markets  
- Dilute stock  

A cash burn rate model.  
While your long/short keeps making money.  
But you also know they will run out of money, so you have a rough estimate of when they will issue...

Hence if you replace banks with intermediary service providers who only consist of debt and no cash, you know during earning calls the movement itself is gonna be volatile.  
And thus build some level of synthetic straddle, strangle (first write a payoff diagram on a A4 and think how this might work).  
If you have a high risk appetite, you can buy the generic straddle strangle call/puts as people nowadays don't have that courage, so I buy mine months ahead while in the past I couldn't.  
I couldn't because my margin for error was too high.  

Now these most basic options are already cheaply discounted months ahead of what is vv much a linear event.  
For an intermediary at this point it's borderline (debt > cash, burn rate is negative, rising rates environment, supply pool of customers has less to spend), it simply means:  
You are short the stock.  
But that costs money—it bleeds.  

So vol boxes ensure stop the bleeding (and so bad vol boxes on 1 singular stock have made me over >10$ million alone) during one event (like earnings).  
So I remember last year Netflix had a >10% move on earnings.  
My vols (capturing the volatility by the generic option strategy, I also used a synthesized mimic of the straddle, I was short the stock), but Netflix as domain is finite...

Meaning a loss for them is a win for Disney streaming, Amazon streaming.  
So simultaneous one event (NFLX earnings) already became >10 trades on Netflix but subsequently on their competitors I also had boxes.  
Because I knew the market had not shown signs of "we understand what we doing" since the war, so it has been one linear trajectory as fuck.  

So not only was I playing Netflix (stock, options, CFDs), I was also playing Disney (at the exact same time), because some hedgies were clever and realized, well, if someone loses, the other gains.  
Governments hand out free debt (long gov FI bonds), the consumers will flip from A to B, so I had trades on direct peers too.

You also know:  
Cost of living > adjusted wages.  

You see governments doing all sorts of fucked up stuff and the markets are penalizing them for it.  
I'm super long *short term* fixed government bonds as they are practically free money.  
I have to, as firms can only dabble in commercial paper, commercial notes, short-term high-liquidity paper to fill and mismatch the gaps in cash flow at the earliest buckets.  

But that told me, in upward future buckets there is misalignment in ALM (cash in, cash out) and risk (monitoring the mismatch), and the modellers did typical hardcoded academic modelling.  
A competitor didn't. You could backtrack this in filings.

Like the differential between interest rate risk and credit spread risk.  
Rates are high, so interest rate risk on the loan books need to be lowered.  
So you dispose.

But how?  
Dispose only bonds? You will materially decrease in value but your risk will spike and I will burn you motherfucker.  

If you dispose the bonds and swaps, are you disposing same tenors?  
Are you disposing exposure to various countries?  
Spread between bonds (30yr–1yr), spread between bonds and swaps of same bucket (1yr–1yr), but an interest rate swap and a bond have offsetting PnL.  
It becomes a delta-neutral strategy. The regulatory metrics of PV01, VaR—they become lower.

However, if your spread risk increases, the way you disposed of your bonds and swaps (as the filing shows lower interest rate risk while the loan book increased), yet the credit spread also increased...

That means that for lowering the interest rate risk of your book, you took on more spread risk.  
Well in today's climate with fixed income being golden nuggets worldwide, that simply tells me psychology-wise what models they use in ALM.  
It also tells me they don't model conditionally the upcoming tenor buckets, so I know, 3, 6, 9 months ahead of their earnings with Joe Consumer having less to spend, margin compression will hurt the firm.  
Their $% profit per $1 revenue declines...

So I assume their inventory and revenue and depreciation will show me golden nuggets of information and I compare that with cash, debt (a cash burn rate model) as to when I suspect to place these trades.  
Hence one event becomes >20/30/40 trades.

I've showed a New Zealand 1-month maturity bond—it's been a free ride, for many countries it is... because they issue debt (not cash) and put a plaster on your forehead while you cut your finger.

This way I made a profit over >£1bn in generalized wealth on my trading accounts in one year, and this year will be worse, as the logic is still the same.  
We are building financial weapons of mass destruction.

Once I realized that New Zealand dairy industry is dead due to their regulatory framework, I realized Fonterra is killing innovation and because of environmental CO2 emissions they kill the one thing that powers their economy—dairy, cows... and the law prohibits them from adjusting and changing that.

So I knew short stock, long government bonds.  
And when I read the whole New Zealand law (DIRA directive), I realize they price their milk on CAPM models, and thought, *HOLY FUCK*.

And then I checked their competitors (Arla, Yili, Irish firms, Sadafco) and saw hey—they do a thing called precision fermentation.  
Da fuck is that and it has my interest. So I funded my own first firm as the basics of PF, the ML around it, is something a dumbass like me understands.

So I needed to be the glue for scientists to continue to develop this further under an entity I set up in a non-listed firm so there isn't regulatory filings.  
So I funded everything myself and that currently runs.  
I then started building racing cockpits.  
While simultaneously still do contracting work.

Because NZD was the main milk exporter of the world—especially milk powder.  
But cows fart... and every hippy 20-year-old wants "climate change" shit and doesn't give a hoot about their economy or others... and are satisfied with measly $200k salary a year. Pathetic losers.

So the Chinese are hoarding everything up. Yili is one of those firms.  
But the thing is, I looked at their filings and they don't hedge *any risk at all*, not in the ratio where they should be.  
So they are heavily prone to all sorts of FX ccy risks, country spread risks, and more.  
So more trades were placed. Volatility to happen, death too.  
Vol > isn't stopping the bleeding anymore—it's making money.

The short is a non-linear trajectory to death, but simply because there is excess liquidity on the market.  
So a "financial dead firm" worth $10, while in reality worth nothing, will bounce from $15 to $5, but you know they will die.  
Question is *when*—and *when* is a function of catalyst and observing evidence that cost of living > adjusted wages is gonna flip.  
I see no such evidence—to the contrary.  
So I know I gotta short (cuz cheap), I know when to put my vol boxes which I draw out—can be a triple box.

Simple straddle and strangle mixed with synthetically created vol boxes (like long a 2nd deriv lower) a firm, a commodity, FX pair (New Zealand has their own currency poor fuckers...)  
So I knew who was importing milk from New Zealand was going to make a change soon, impacting NZD FX pairs, especially the countries they export and import from.  
And this derives back in fixed income, especially in the short-term buckets (as the liquidity gaps for governments are all about short-term mismatches).

They propose ridiculous rules (tax red meat, airplane tickets)—all band-aid solutions that has governments been protege for 20 years, stuck in a loop.  
So free money once more.

You then check if other firms are dumping NZD exposure, gosh they do, what a surprise 🫣  
And then you monitor bond (short and long-term spreads), and monitor the credit spreads of the firms who hold the bags of money (banks).  
More trades once more.

You then keep a look out for retail and see their inventories decline, as they never made money last years, negative FCF, negative profit margin—this will *die*, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when. And which catalyst.

And for many of these firms it trickles down to product chain management.  
A toy car needs to be built before it sits in a retail firm.  

With commodity being volatile and scarce (you know transport costs is an extra + on the product), commodity sits in a different FX pair.  
So you pick up FX too.  
You also know inventory will decline and if the firm has debt > cash, negative FCF, preferably floating—you know death will occur.  
If you then just think, hey you, yes *you firm*, what do you offer to society, and realize it's basically nothing—we can do without them—and you pick up extra money in a vol box when they do the sheep behaviour of:

- Knocking on capital markets' door for issuance  
- Dilute equity by rights offerings  
- Etc...

As you can forecast when they will do this.  
Because you know they will.  

And if it's an intermediary, they don't own inventory, so they won't be bought up, or bailed out like Uniper.  
So death *will occur*.  

With firms that provide service to average Joe with no knowledge of ALM, risk management and basically no primary school maths (like the _30%_ stake in Uniper) and they say *we took a majority (ehm, no...) stake to prevent them from falling down*  
I knew bailout two was gonna happen, and given Germany’s cash position I would not be surprised for a full acquisition/nationalisation of these firms, so more vol boxes and shorts.

As the vol boxes confirm the hypothesis that most market participants have too much printed debt on their hands (given the printing last 10 years, logic) and their actions are delusional, borderline runaway mental ward behaviour...  
So they can't read an actual filing but need a 10k code page in ML to forecast what way this moves.  
They measure this by dumb option risk metrics so I am one step ahead of the *newer* hedge funds as rebirth of Sharpe, Vega, etc. has reborn.

I've been an ex-head of market risk of various large books >xxth billions of all desks.  
I know based on size of a firm what Vega they look at for example.  
I can backtrack that and we simply exploit those boutiques’ dumb new junior hedge funds as they have yet to discover far further knowledge on much lower Greek derivatives and also synthetically reproduce them through different products, like NDFs, FRAs, caplets, shares, etc.

That’s why since Putin yelled  
*BOOOO*  
It’s been pouring money ever since.

But:  
1) no one has patience  
2) want to see the money asap  
3) don’t hedge it off  

And I see a 10% return deviation for a big firm in one day, compare that to historical returns and think...  
*here we go again*...
